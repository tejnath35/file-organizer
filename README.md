🗃️ File Organizer with GUI and Undo Functionality
A handy desktop app built with Python and Tkinter to automate file organization with a clean, user-friendly interface. Designed for clarity, customization, and real-world usability.
✨ Features
- Simple GUI: Easily select your target folder with a clean, intuitive interface.
- Automatic Sorting: Organizes files into subfolders by extension (e.g., .jpg, .pdf, .py).
- Undo Functionality: Revert the last organization step if needed—mistakes happen!
- Drag-and-Drop Ready (optional enhancement): Quick file selection from desktop.
- Log System (optional): Records each sorting action for reference or rollback.
📦 How It Works

- Use “Undo” to reverse the most recent organization step.
